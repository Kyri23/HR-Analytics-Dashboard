# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Showcasing my proficiency in data visualization and analytics by utilizing Microsoft Power BI. This project involved categorizing employees by gender and distance from the office, providing valuable insights into workforce demographics. Additionally, the dashboard effectively displayed the number of employees eligible for promotion and those at risk for retrenchment, facilitating strategic workforce planning. The inclusion of service years and employee ratings enhanced the dashboard's depth, offering a holistic view of the organization's talent landscape. This project not only demonstrated my technical skills in Power BI but also showcased my ability to translate complex HR data into actionable insights, contributing to informed decision-making in talent management.
